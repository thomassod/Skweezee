# Skweezee
### Description
- The re Arduino code for the Skweezee project, extended for the Arduino Zero with functionality for the MPU-9250 motion sensor.

- A Skweezee is an interactive system—including input & output, that responds to squeezes. The Skweezee technology implements the sensing of squeezes through ‘computationally enabled’ soft materials; the computation of the sensed squeezes to a workable format; and the generation of an appropriate system reaction. Skweezee aims to preserve the rich dynamics of squeezes.
